	 Target architecture is SMP or not. This option will be 
	 automatically enabled by CPU specific config.

		Specify the virtual address pool size in mega bytes.

	int "Virtual address pool alignment size (in MB)"
	default 8
	help
		Specify the alignment size (in MB) requirement for
		VA Pool start. This is used for calulating max bin
		while initializing buddy allocator for VA pool.

config CONFIG_HOST_IRQ_COUNT
	int "Maximum number of Host IRQs"
	default 1024
	help
		The Host IRQ subsystems needs to know maximum number of
		Host IRQs on a host which can vary for different Hosts
		even for same architecture.

		This option is used to specify the maximum number of 
		Host IRQs for underlying Host.

		Generally, the default value of maximum Host IRQs will
		be large enough so that it is suitable for most Hosts.
