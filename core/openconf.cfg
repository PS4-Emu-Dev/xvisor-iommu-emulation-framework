comment "General Configuration"

config CONFIG_MODULES
	bool "Runtime loadable modules support"
	default y
	help
	  Hypervisor modules are small pieces of compiled code which can
	  be inserted in the running kernel, rather than being
	  permanently built into the kernel. If you say Y here,
	  many parts of the hypervisor can be built as modules (by
	  answering M instead of Y where indicated): this is most
	  useful for infrequently used options which are not required
	  for booting.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config CONFIG_VERBOSE_MODE
	bool "Verbose Mode"
	default n
	help
	  Print too many message of events at boot time, normal operation, and
	  shutdionw time. 

config CONFIG_LOG_LEVEL
	int "Log level"
	default 6
	range 0 6
	help
	  Set the default log level, between 0 (emergency only) and 6 (all
	  messages and notices). This can be changed with the
	  "stdio change_loglevel" command.

config CONFIG_LOG_ANSI_COLORS
	bool "ANSI Log Colors"
	default n
	help
	  Use ANSI colors in Xvisor log.
	  If the terminal emulator which you use to monitor Xvisor
	  support ANSI colors, you should say Y.

config CONFIG_IRQ_STACK_SIZE
	int "Stack Size for Interrupt Processing."
	default 4096

config CONFIG_THREAD_STACK_SIZE
	int "Stack Size for Threads."
	default 8192

config CONFIG_MAX_RAM_BANK_COUNT
	int "Max. RAM Bank Count"
	default 16
	help
	  Specify the maximum number of RAM banks allowed in the system.
	  NOTE: This may vary from one hardware to another based. The board
	  specific default configuration may hold appropriate value of this
	  parameter for your board.

config CONFIG_MAX_VCPU_COUNT
	int "Max. VCPU Count"
	default 64
	help
	  Specify the maximum number of VCPUs allowed in the system.
	  NOTE: This may vary from one hardware to another based. The board
	  specific default configuration may hold appropriate value of this
	  parameter for your board.

config CONFIG_MAX_GUEST_COUNT
	int "Max. Guest Count"
	default 16
	help
	  Specify the maximum number of Guests allowed in the system.
	  NOTE: This may vary from one hardware to another based. The board
	  specific default configuration may hold appropriate value of this
	  parameter for your board.

config CONFIG_MEMMAP_HASH_SIZE_FACTOR
	int "Max. enteries in host memmap hash as factor of pages in VAPOOL"
	default 2
	help
	  Specify the maximum number of enteries in host memmap hash as factor
	  of pages in VAPOOL. In other words, if we have N pages in VAPOOL
	  then N / CONFIG_MEMMAP_HASH_SIZE_FACTOR is number of enteries in
	  host memmap hash. This hash is used to keep track of all physical
	  address to virtual address mapping so that we can retrive virtual
	  address from given physical address at any point in time.

config CONFIG_VGPA2REG_CACHE_SIZE
	int "Guest Physical Address To Region Cache Size"
	default 8
	help
	  Specify size of virtual guest physical address to region translation
	  cache size.

config CONFIG_WFI_TIMEOUT_MSECS
	int "Wait for IRQ timeout milliseconds"
	default 100
	range 10 60000

config CONFIG_DEVEMU_DEBUG
	bool "Debug Emulators"
	default n
	help
	  Enable/Disable emulators debugging interface.
	  In the Device Trees, one can set debug flags
	  in a node, to get runtime information about
	  what an emulator is doing.

config CONFIG_PROFILE
	bool "Hypervisor Profiler"
	default n
	help
	  Enable hypervisor profiling feature which can gather profiling 
	  information using features of GCC.

config CONFIG_LOADBAL
	bool "Hypervisor SMP Load Balancing"
	depends on CONFIG_SMP
	default n
	help
	  Enable hypervisor SMP load balacing feature which allows runtime
	  balancing of VCPUs across host CPUs based on load.

comment "Heap Configuration"

config CONFIG_HEAP_SIZE_FACTOR
	int "Size of heap as factor of VAPOOL size"
	default 3
	help
	  Specify the size of heap as factor VAPOOL size. In other words,
	  if we have N size VAPOOL then N / CONFIG_HEAP_SIZE_FACTOR is the
	  size of heap. In addition, the heap size will be rounded-up to be
	  multiple of hugepage size.

config CONFIG_DMA_HEAP_SIZE_FACTOR
	int "Size of DMA heap as factor of VAPOOL size"
	default 24
	help
	  Specify the size of DMA heap as factor VAPOOL size. In other words,
	  if we have N size VAPOOL then N / CONFIG_DMA_HEAP_SIZE_FACTOR is the
	  size of DMA heap. In addition, the DMA heap size is rounded-up to be
	  multiple of page size.

choice
	prompt "Default Time Slice (milliseconds)"
	default CONFIG_TSLICE_10MS
	help
	  Select the default time slice for each VCPU in milliseconds. 
	  The default time slice will be used when we dont specify time slice
	  for Normal VCPU, Orphan VCPU or Threads.

config CONFIG_TSLICE_1MS
	bool "1 msec"
	help
	  Time slice of 1 milliseconds

config CONFIG_TSLICE_10MS
	bool "10 msec"
	help
	  Time slice of 10 milliseconds

config CONFIG_TSLICE_100MS
	bool "100 msec"

	  Time slice of 100 milliseconds

config CONFIG_IDLE_TSLICE_SECS
	int "Idle Time Slice (seconds)"
	default 1
	help
	  Time slice of IDLE Orphan VCPU (or Thread).

config CONFIG_IDLE_PERIOD_SECS
	int "Idle Time Sampling Period (seconds)"
	default 2
	help
	  Interval (in seconds) at which idleness
	  of a host CPU is measured.

comment "Load Balancer Configuration"

config CONFIG_LOADBAL_PERIOD_SECS
	int "Load balancing period (seconds)"
	default 5

	  Interval (in seconds) at which the load balancer is
	  invoked to do the balancing task.
