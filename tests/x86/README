1. Creating an initrd for Xvisor

# mounting xvisor IDE disk on host
Run the following command on the disk that was create using qemu command.
This command should attach a loopback device to the disk and print the
name of the loopback device.

	$ sudo losetup --partscan --find --show xvisor-hd.disk
	$ /dev/loop41 <<<< This is the loopback device attached to xvisor disk.

We need to mount this on host
	$ sudo mount /dev/<loopback device> <mountpoint>

After that run the following commands:
	$ mkdir -p <mountpoint>/system
	$ mkdir -p <mountpoint>/guests/common
	$ mkdir -p <mountpoint>/guests/intel
	$ dtc -q -I dts -O dtb -o <mountpoint>/guests/intel/intel-guest.dtb ./tests/x86/intel-guest.dts
	$ cp <seabiosdir>/out/bios.bin <mountpoint>/guests/common/bios.bin
	$ cp tests/x86/xscripts/one_guest.xscript <mountpoint>/guests/intel/guest_create.xscript

Now, the disk can be unmounted and the loopback device be detached.
	$ umount <mountpoint>
	$ sudo losetup -d /dev/<loopbackdevice>
