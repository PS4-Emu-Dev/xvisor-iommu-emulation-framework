		Xvisor Supported toolchains

There are many cross compiler toolchains out there, but we cannot
guaranty that they would all work with Xvisor code.

Therefore we do recommend to use the cross toolchains available
from ARM Ltd or kernel.org as a reference.

You can find them at:
https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-a/downloads
https://www.kernel.org/pub/tools/crosstool/

The reasons for preferring ARM Ltd or kernel.org cross toolchains are:
1. Its unaltered open-source GCC compiled using crosstool.
2. The kernel.org toolchain is without libc so if we accidently
   include any c library header then compilation will fail. The
   ARM Ltd toolchain generally comes with open-souce glibc.

The above is true to compile Xvisor itself (or the guest linux kernel
for the matter).

You will still need a glibc based cross toolchain to build the RootFS
user space image. For this purpose, you should prefer ARM Ltd toolchain
or some open source toolchain. You could also use proprietary tooolchain
(such as codesourcery) here but we dont support.
 
Note however that We will not restrict users from using their favorite
GCC flavour to compile Xvisor.

Our stand on toolchains is as follows:
1. Xvisor will always compile & work using vanilla GCC from
   gcc.gnu.org or ARM Ltd or kernel.org without any c library.
2. We will not entertain bugs or issues manifested by using a
   particular flavour or modified GCC
