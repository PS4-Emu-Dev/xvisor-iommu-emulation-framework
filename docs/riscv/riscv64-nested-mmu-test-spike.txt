	Xvisor RISC-V 64bit Nested MMU Test on Spike Simulator

This section of readme explains how to build & run Xvisor RISC-V 64bit
nested MMU test-suite on Spike simulator.

Please follow the steps below for nested MMU test-suite on Spike:

  [1. Build environment for Xvisor]
  # CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-

  [2. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [3. Configure Xvisor with Generic-64bit default settings]
  # make ARCH=riscv generic-64b-defconfig

  [4. Enable Nested MMU test-suite for Xvisor]
  # make ARCH=riscv menuconfig
  (Select/enable "Library Options" ==> "White-box testing library")

  [5. Build Xvisor & DTBs]
  # make

  [6. GoTo OpenSBI source directory]
  # cd <opensbi_source_directory>

  [7. Build OpenSBI]
  # make PLATFORM=generic

  [8. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [9. Run nested MMU test-suite]
  # spike -m512 --isa rv64gch --kernel ./build/vmm.bin --bootargs 'vmm.bootcmd="wboxtest run_groups 1 nested_mmu"' <opensbi_source_directory>/build/platform/generic/firmware/fw_jump.elf
  OR
  # spike -m512 --isa rv64gch --kernel ./build/vmm.bin <opensbi_source_directory>/build/platform/generic/firmware/fw_jump.elf
  XVisor# wboxtest run_groups 1 nested_mmu

  (Note: replace all <> brackets based on your workspace)
  (Note: some of the above steps will need to be adapted for other
   types of RISC-V host)
  (Note: for more info on your desired RISC-V host refer docs/riscv/)
  (Note: you are free to change the ordering of above steps based
   on your workspace)
